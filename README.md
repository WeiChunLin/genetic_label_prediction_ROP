# ROP Genetic Risk Prediction Model

## Description
This repository contains a Python script for predicting genetic risk from images using a convolutional neural network, specifically EfficientNet V2 Large. The program includes a GUI for easy interaction, allowing users to select a pre-trained model and image folder for making predictions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Pandas
- PyTorch and torchvision

## Usage
1. Run `genetic_risk_modelv2.py` in your Python environment.
2. Use the GUI to select the model file when prompted.
3. Choose the folder with the images you want to predict genetic risk.

The script will output the prediction results, which can be further analyzed.
